# Important:
You will need a MySQL database, and MySQLOO V8.

You can get MySQLOO from here:
http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1220537

#Setup:
Make sure the folder name is applejack, not applejack-master, and put the folder into /gamemodes/ in your gmod directory.
Edit the sh_config.lua and sv_config.lua to your liking.

----------------------------------------------------
Login to PHPMyAdmin, make a new user + database, and import the players.sql
After doing that, open up your sh_config.lua, and fill in the details. Do not touch the "players" part, as importing the .sql does that automatically.

If you get any errors, it's probably because you didn't setup your SQL correctly.
----------------------------------------------------

(You'll also need libmysql, you can get that from the same place as MySQLOO)

#Extra:
You will need evolve or exsto (for now) for this gamemode to work properly, and I'll be activly working on this.

If you need help, feel free to PM me on facepunch. 

Please stop trying to sell this gamemode.

##IMPORTANT:
I will no longer be giving support for this gamemode, unless a Garry's Mod update breaks it. As of 1/6/2016 I have tested it, and it works as intended.
