config["Rules"] = [[
<Rules>
[General]
1. Do not break NLR. NLR is a new life rule. You forgot everything of your past life.
2. Don't spam.
3. Do not RDM - RDM stands for Random Death Match. Do not just randomly kill people which will fllow to a ban.
4. Follow FearRP - If someone has a gun on your head you are to do what they say.
5. Do no failRP - If your a gun dealer you don't randomly steal peoples cars. You roleplay to what your job is. Custom jobs are to follow the same thing.
6. Do not Random Arrest(RDA) - You have to have a reasoning behind it.
7. Do not randomly steal cars(RGTA) - If your say some kind of rebel or mafia you must have a reasoning behind stealing the car.
8. No Random Raiding(RR) - You must have a reason behind it. A RP Reason. Laws are a reason to raid or dictaorship.
9. If you are to have anything like [FF] which is what the admins use you will be asked to remove it, if you don't you will be banned perminantly as this is impersonating a member of Staff.
10. The president can not random warrant people for search or arrest. There must be a reasoning behind it like contraban/money printers. (or not complying to the laws after warning by a Police Officer.)
11. Prop Spamming/Surfing/Pushing/Blocking/Throwing and Flipping is all against the rules. If you break this rule you will be instantly ban by a staff member for 1 day and if this continues it will lead to a week then a month.
12. There no arguing or sexual talk to be had in OOC.
13. No one way see threw props. Do not let us catch you doing this. We will remove your Prop permissions.
14. If anyone is to enter the cave at the lake. You will be permenatly ban as this crashes the server!
15. Do not metagame. When you approuch someone you do not know there name. You do not ask people where they are in OOC. You use /pm. Also if someone you know like your friend or someone is a Police officer, President or any job you can't randomly kill them. This is metagaming. You don't know them in RP and you can't RDM them over a real life situation. This will result on a day ban and so on and so forth.
16. Do not backseat adminstrate. If someone is say CDMing you do not shoot them or handle it with death or CDMing them back. You call a admin to the situation or screenshot them breaking the rules. Then you would tell me intill I have set up our website with a ban request section of the fourms.
17. Do not random tase. This goes for all the jobs. This goes toward FailRP and FearRP. If your being arrested and they have a taser on you. You comply to what they tell you to do.
18. Do not minge. Minging is purposly trying to ruin roleplay and other peoples memorys on the server. These examples are hitting people with axes, random tasing and the rules above.
19. No mic spamming or spamming the chats in general.
20. You have 1 warning, after this you will be banned for a day. Read the rules or be banned.
21. Our staff team is to be chosen by the High up Staff members. Asking for staff is not a option. You will be denied your chance.
22. Rasism and Harassment is not accepted here. If you want to do this stuff go do it some where else. I and my staff do not tolerate this. Perminant ban.
23. The pointshop suits and dresses will be based on how good your rp's are. You can share your rp experiences and builds on the fourms. If people relpy with good feedback and comments on the fourms/post, and how we see the roleplay as amazing, fun, well built you will be given a point for the pointshop. The models will cost more then 1 point. It's not going to be easy. Roleplay well and you will be rewarded.
24. Do not public build without a staff member giving you the ok to build this.
25. If you ask to be a staff member you will be automatically denied and you will have to start from the beggining of gaining our trust.
26. you get <b>one</b> warning after reading this rule. After you break this one warning you will be ban the next time. All suggestions are to be given to any higher up staff.
27. Enjoy and Roleplay. Remember the rules as these come in handy :). Please share and tell your friends to join and have fun with this new community.
